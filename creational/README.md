# Creational Patterns

This patterns are focus to solve the object creation. Those use inheritance or delegation to create object.

## List of patterns

* Abstract Factory - Creates an object from multiples families
* Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
* Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist
